Measure Projection Toolbox (MPT) is an open source Matlab toolbox for probabilistic multi-subject EEG independent component source comparison and inference (an alternative to IC clustering). It was developed by Nima Bigdely-Shamlo, PhD at Swartz Center for Computational Neuroscience, UCSD with help from Özgür Yiğit Balkan, PhD.

Measure Projection reference paper was published in NeuroImage and made it to the cover of the magazine:
