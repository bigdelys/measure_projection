**Important note:** This is a legacy plugin that is no longer compatible with EEGLAB. From the EEGLAB plugin manager, use the *mp_clustering* plugin instead for clustering components, and the *NIMA* plugin for display.

Measure Projection Toolbox (MPT) is an open source Matlab toolbox for probabilistic multi-subject EEG independent component source comparison and inference (an alternative to IC clustering). It was developed by Nima Bigdely-Shamlo, PhD at Swartz Center for Computational Neuroscience, UCSD with help from Özgür Yiğit Balkan, PhD.

Measure Projection reference paper was published in NeuroImage and made it to the cover of the magazine:
